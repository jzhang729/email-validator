## Instructions

Before you begin, make sure you have the latest versions of Node JS and NPM.

Inside the project folder, run the following command in the terminal. This will install project dependencies on the client and server.

```
npm run setup
```

The project has a `.env` file that requires a [Kickbox.io](http://kickbox.io) API key. The project has the sandbox key from my account by default, but feel free to replace with your own to get actual API responses.

The default typeahead e-mail suggestions are:

```
'gmail.com',
'gmail.co.uk',
'hotmail.com',
'yahoo.com',
'yahoo.ca'
```

These can be modified inside of the `client/config.js` file.

Run the npm 'dev' script.

```
npm run dev
```
